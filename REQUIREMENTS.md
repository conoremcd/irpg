Other current platforms for tabletop RPG games, such as D&D Beyond and Roll20, often require extensive knowledge about the game or put content behind expensive paywalls, and many features of the gameplay supported are not universally accessible. Player characters also tend to have an abundance of features, bonuses, and contextual actions that requires players to have in depth knowledge, and these are often forgotten or ignored during gameplay.
